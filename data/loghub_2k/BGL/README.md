## BGL
BGL is an open dataset of logs collected from a BlueGene/L supercomputer system at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL) in Livermore, California, with 131,072 processors and 32,768GB memory. The log contains alert and non-alert messages identified by alert category tags. In the first column of the log, "-" indicates non-alert messages while others are alert messages. The label information is amenable to alert detection and prediction research. It has been used in several studies on log parsing, anomaly detection, and failure prediction.
