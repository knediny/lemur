## OpenStack

OpenStack (https://www.openstack.org) is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter. This dataset was generated on [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us/), a flexible, scientific infrastructure for research on cloud computing. Both normal logs and abonormal cases with failure injection are provided, making the data amenable to anomaly detection research. 

For the usage of this dataset, please refer to an example: https://github.com/nailo2c/deeplog/blob/master/example/preprocess.py

### Download
The raw logs are available for downloading at https://github.com/logpai/loghub.
