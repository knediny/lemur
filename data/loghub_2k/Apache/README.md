## Apache
Apache HTTP Server (https://httpd.apache.org) is one of the most popular web servers. Apache servers usually generate two types of logs: access logs and error logs. We provide an error log for the purpose of research on anomaly detection and diagnosis. The log file was collected from a Linux system running Apache Web server.

For more detailed information, please visit the Public Security Log Sharing Site: http://log-sharing.dreamhosters.com.
