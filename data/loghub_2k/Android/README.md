## Android_v1
Android (https://www.android.com) is a popular open-source mobile operating system and has been used by many smart devices. However, Android logs are rarely available in public for research purposes. We provide some Android log files, which were collected by Android smartphones with heavily instrumented modules installed. The Android architecture comprises of five levels, including the Linux Kernel, Libraries, Application Framework, Android Runtime, and System Applications. We provide a sample log file printed by the Application Framework.

## Android_v2
Android (https://www.android.com) is a popular open-source mobile operating system and has been used by many smart devices. However, Android logs are rarely available in public for research purposes. We provide some Android log files, which were collected by Android smartphones with heavily instrumented modules installed. The logs cover two types of issues, and each type has over 10 duplicate issue logs. However, due to the high complexity of Android's multi-threading system, it is difficult to pinpoint the abnormal log points.
